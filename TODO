- Photon mapping?
- Only allocate more samples when increasing the root; when decreasing,
  just use the same sample sets
- Make text overlay nicer (alpha-blended background)
- Object picking for fun and profit:
  - live object transformations? select an object, use mouse and/or
    keyboard to set transformation mode (scale/translate + axis), update
    scene accordingly
  - Requires host-side scene description and scene-building with single
    transfer to GPU rather than per-pixel, per-sample scene-building
  - Requires object transformation support
  - Need to pass a flag through to tell the renderer which object to
    select, i.e., override material
- Image output capability (keypress -> write image) (it would be nice
  to be able to load a scene from disk and use its name when writing an
  image)
- Consider increasing window height to make room for overlay (always on,
  image height + height of overlay)
- main(): do one GL acquire/release by allocating relevant GL objects
  adjacently
- Use window dimensions to aid in adjusting camera parameters
  (perspective distortion is extreme for some window sizes)
- Add shortcut keys for adjusting the focal and view distances

Other:
- Path tracing w/environment lights, concave spheres
- Triangle meshes
- Area lighting
- Regular grids
- Refactor/tear down existing materials and lighting and replace with
  book implementations
