- Runtime changes in sample count (w/regeneration of sample values)
- Acceleration: regular grids?
- Make text overlay nicer
- Object picking for fun and profit
- Ambient occlusion
- Triangle meshes
- Path tracing w/environment lights (concave spheres)
- Area lighting
- Host-side scene description and scene-building with single transfer to
  GPU rather than per-pixel, per-sample scene-building
- Make it possible to batch-process sample ranges in a single GPU pass
  (and to configure the batch size)
- Use union type for shapes rather than having a separate array for each
  shape type in the scene description
- Image output capability (keypress -> write image)
