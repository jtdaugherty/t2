Increments:

- Basic opencl kernel (hello world) and main() to set it up
- OpenCL kernel to mess with color buffer, main() to set that up
- OpenCL kernel to mess with color buffer (initially all black, set to
white) and GLFW main() to display it in a window

Other:
- Command-line argument processing to set
  * log level and destination
  * device preference (e.g. cpu vs gpu)
