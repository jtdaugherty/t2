- Runtime changes in sample count (w/regeneration of sample values)
  - Requires free/malloc of sample data with corresponding latency
- Acceleration: regular grids?
- Make text overlay nicer
- Object picking for fun and profit
- Ambient occlusion
- Triangle meshes
- Path tracing w/environment lights, concave spheres
- Area lighting
- Host-side scene description and scene-building with single transfer to
  GPU rather than per-pixel, per-sample scene-building
- Make it possible to batch-process sample ranges in a single GPU pass
  (and to configure the batch size) and also investigate any performance
  difference yielded by batching samples
- Image output capability (keypress -> write image)
- Consider increasing window height to make room for overlay (always on,
  image height + height of overlay)
- Use consistent capitalization
- Compute overlay line height from font rather than hard-coding
- main(): do one GL acquire/release by allocating relevant GL objects
  adjacently
