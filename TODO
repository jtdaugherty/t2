- Runtime changes in sample count (w/regeneration of sample values)
  - Requires free/malloc of sample data with corresponding latency
- Acceleration: regular grids?
- Make text overlay nicer (alpha-blended background)
- Object picking for fun and profit:
  - live object transformations? select an object, use mouse and/or
    keyboard to set transformation mode (scale/translate + axis), update
    scene accordingly
  - Requires host-side scene description and scene-building with single
    transfer to
- Ambient occlusion
  - Requires hemispherical sample sets
  - Requires ambient occluding ambient light
- Refactor/tear down existing materials and lighting and replace with
  book implementations
- Triangle meshes
- Path tracing w/environment lights, concave spheres
- Area lighting
  GPU rather than per-pixel, per-sample scene-building
- Make it possible to batch-process sample ranges in a single GPU pass
  (and to configure the batch size) and also investigate any performance
  difference yielded by batching samples. With a sufficiently large
  batch size this might help reduce spatial jitter when a frame begins
  rendering. But for slow-rendering scenes (e.g. path-traced scenes)
  when a single sample rendering time is long enough, we might not
  want to batch at all. Maybe this could be learned as the program
  renders its first few frames: if the per-sample time is very low
  (below some reasonable threshold) the batch size could be increased
  until an optimal point is found, up to some limit (since we want to
  render 25-30 real frames per second, so we need to figure out how many
  samples we can render in 1/25th to 1/30th of a second).
- Image output capability (keypress -> write image)
- Consider increasing window height to make room for overlay (always on,
  image height + height of overlay)
- Use consistent capitalization
- main(): do one GL acquire/release by allocating relevant GL objects
  adjacently
- Send program state to OpenCL via cl_mem rather than sending many state
  fields as individual parameters
- Factor sampling setup out of main()?
